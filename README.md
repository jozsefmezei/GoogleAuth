# About
Based on https://github.com/wstrange/GoogleAuth. This library written for Android Clients in Java 8. 

# Demo
![Main screen](/demo/device-screen.png)


# What is
 - TOTP password: The Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP) is an algorithm that computes a one-time password from a shared secret key and the current time.
 - Secret key: unique string, which known by the device and server as well

# Features:
 - token generating time by time
 - time synchronisation default implementation 
 - time correction in run time (after sync)
 - offline working
 - 6 or 8 digits support
 
 # Dependency
 
 Add the JitPack repository into your project level gradle:
 ```groovy
 allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
  }
  ```
  
 Add the dependency into your app level gradle:
  ```groovy
dependencies {
	      implementation 'com.github.jozsefmezei:GoogleAuth:1.3.6'
	}
```

# How to use
```kotlin
// Init ------------------
val config = GoogleAuthenticatorConfig.GoogleAuthenticatorConfigBuilder()
                .setHmacHashFunction(HmacHashFunction.HmacSHA256)
                .setCodeDigits(6)
                .setWindowSize(3)
                .setEncodeType(BaseUtils.BaseType.BASE_32)
                .build()

var authenticator = GoogleAuthenticator(config)
authenticator.setSecureRandom(ReseedingSecureRandom(authenticator?.getRandomNumberAlgorithm()))
 
 // Start token generation       
authenticator.startTotpPasswordGeneration(this, twoaf, value)
 
// Listener --------------
   private val twoaf = object : Twoaf {
        override fun onTokenChangedListener(token: String?, remainingTimeInSeconds: Long) {
            // do somethnig on background
        }

        override fun onTokenChangedUIListener(token: String, remainingTimeInSeconds: Long) {
            // do somethnig on UI
        }
    }
```
